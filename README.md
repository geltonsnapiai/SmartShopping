## For developers

### Development plan
See dev [plan](PLAN.md).

### Contributing rules
`master` branch is for tested code that is final. `dev` branch is for 
active development. No commits are allowed to either of these branches.
All code changes must be commited to feature branches and then merged in to `dev` branch. After that `dev` can be merged into `master`.
Feature branch names should start with `feature-` prefix. 

### Workflow
#### Steps
 - Update local repository or clone it from remote.
 - Create `feature` branch from `dev`. 
 - Make changes and commits to it. 
 - Push/publish it to remote.
 - Create pull request.

#### Tips
 - Clone repository to your local machine or sync your local repository with remote. Make sure that `dev` is up to date.
 - Make commits as often as possible.
 - Write meaningful descriptions to commits, pull requests.
